                Looking at the level of High School education and how education focus has changed in Australia over time.   
                Also focusing on how levels of education differs within different location in NSW and whether level of education impacts the amount of household income.  

            </p>

            <p> 
                Within Australia, Year 12 is a key factor in helping to increase an indviduals knowledge and skills. Studnets who complete high school through Year 12 generally go on to further their studies, this will further help them to get a job in a skilled workforce, contributing to society and  boosting the economy.

            <p> How does data journalism help us learn about level of education in NSW?<br></br>
                Data journalism is the use of numbers and data to tell a story. Data journalism can be either a tool to identify the source in which a story is originated or a tool to tell the story. It is often presented visually through the use of graphs, charts or infographics to make the data quicker and easier to understand. <br></br>
    
    
                According to Alberto Cairo, a data visualization expert, 
                “Visualizations no longer just complement a written story. In our increasingly data-driven world, they’re becoming a mainstream story form and an essential tool for journalists.” (Powerbi microsoft, 2017)<br></br>

                Data journalism has emerged as a new branch of journalism, thanks to the sheer scale of digital information now available and the software that may be used to crunch that data into useful forms. Data journalism is a corollary to big data, which aims to find exploitable patterns in user data and other information generated by businesses.

            The graph highlights that the percentage of poeple who complete high school through to year 12 has increased substancially since about 60 years ago. The graphs displays a great increase of education in weast New South Wales. For adults aged 75-84, areas closer to the city displayed a higher percentage of people who completed year 12. This area spreads as the years go by, showing an improvemtn of level of education accross NSW.
                
            </p>

            <h4> <b>The Australian Government </b></h4>
            <p>

            This would give the Australian Government insight onto NSW's level of edcation and assess where education needs to be imporoved. "The Council of Australian Governments' National Education Agreement (2009) aims to increase the level of year 12 attainment rate for 20-24 year olds to 90% by 2016" (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011). The Government can use this data to monitor the increase or decrease of the rate of change within education attainment. They can use this data to analyse patterns or trends within the data, such as; which locations have a higher high school completion rate. They can then investigate why and make improvements to help increase the number of students to graduate high school.

                The Graph displays which area had the higher proportion of people who completed either grade 10 or grade 12 level of education<br></br>
                The data reveals that more young vs older people in Sydney have completed grade 12.  Intuitively, this makes sense, as there’s a higher focus on education these days vs day past.  Southern Sydney vs Northern Sydney has a higher concentration of people Who completed only to grade 10, While Northern Sydney significantly highlights a higher percentage of older people completed through to grade 12 within the area.
                This can be linked to the idea of <b>blue vs white collar workers.</b> The results make intuitive sense, as Southern Sydney has a higher proportion of blue collar vs white collar workers. The blue collar workers are generally less likely to have completed grade 12, dropping out early to complete a trade.  <br> </br>
