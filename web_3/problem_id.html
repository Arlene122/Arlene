                Through looking at data we can see the level of High School education within New South Wales and how education and see how it has changed over time.   
                We can focus on how levels of education differs within different location in NSW and whether level of education impacts the amount of household income.
                <b>The two graphs side by side display that people living west of the city have a lower percentage rate of completing year 12, and generally receiving a lower income. </b>

            </p>

            <p  style = "text-align: left"> 
                Within Australia, Year 12 is a key factor in helping to increase an indviduals knowledge and skills. Studnets who complete high school through Year 12 generally go on to further their studies, this will further help them to get a job in a skilled workforce, contributing to society and  boosting the economy. While over time the number of people who complete year 12 has increased there is still a lot of studnets that drop out of school after year 10. This is usually because they want to complete a trade. If both high school education and trade education were combined together, this could increase the percentage of students that complete year 12.

                These two graphs highlight the corrolation between level of education and weekly income. The locations with a higher percentage of students that completed year 12 also have a higher weekly income rate.
