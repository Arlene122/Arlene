      <h4> <b>Store Owners </b></h4>
      <p> While no one was opposed to the idea of the transformation, there has been negative feedback from store owners, complaing about the constrction. Due to the construction many roads have been closed off, reducing sales for many store owners. Sydney Morning Herald interviewed an owner of a store along george street who stated that "the proft has gone down most days to a quarter, when they started (construction on) this side, it went down to half but now it's a quarter," Mrs Wu said (4). Many store owners have been struggling with the reduction of sales due to construction. <br> </br>However, once the first strip was completed and opened to the public, there has been some positive feedback. The 'Herald' interviewed a lady (Mrs Mudditt) who mentioned that the the area is "a lot nicer – it will make a huge difference," (2). Another man mentioned that "Without doubt this is a vast improvement for the public. If it worked it would be fantastic and I think there is no question that something has to be done with the infrastructure in Sydney," (2).

      <h4> <b>City Workers</b> </h4>
      <p> Many city workers have complained about the destracting noise afffecting their work.
